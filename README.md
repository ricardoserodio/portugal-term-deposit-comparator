🔗 **Live App:** https://pt-deposit-comparator.streamlit.app

A Python/Streamlit tool to compare Portuguese term deposits by estimated net yield, maturity, eligibility criteria, liquidity conditions and official source validation status.

This project was created as a practical banking and data analysis portfolio project, combining financial product analysis, Python, pandas, Streamlit, Plotly, official source tracking, FIN/PDF review and an AI-assisted human-in-the-loop validation workflow.

Beyond the simulator itself, this repository includes a source mapping and validation layer designed to make the dataset more transparent, auditable and closer to a real banking data governance process.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compare term deposit products available in Portugal and estimate the net return for different maturities and investment amounts.

The tool allows users to filter deposits based on:

- Investment amount
- Maturity
- Bank
- New client eligibility
- New money requirements
- Early withdrawal conditions
- Estimated withholding tax

The output ranks eligible deposits by estimated net interest.

The project is designed not only as a simulator, but also as a practical example of banking product analysis, financial calculation logic, official source monitoring, AI-assisted validation and controlled dataset governance.

---

## Market Scope

The dataset focuses on:

- Portuguese banks
- Banks with physical or established presence in Portugal
- Selected online banks relevant to Portuguese residents

The dataset is manually curated and should always be validated against official bank documentation before any financial decision.

---

- FIN/PDF validation reader for official bank product documents
- Manual review workflow before dataset updates
- Approved update workflow for controlled dataset changes
- Data quality and validation transparency inside the Streamlit app

---

## Why This Project Matters

This is not only a deposit comparison app.

It is also a small data governance workflow for financial product information:

1. Data is collected and structured.
2. Official bank sources are mapped.
3. Source coverage is audited.
4. AI proposes validation results from official sources.
5. Human review approves or rejects the proposal.
6. Approved records are written to a validation log.
7. Exceptions are documented in a manual review queue.

This approach reduces blind trust in scraped or manually entered financial data and keeps uncertain records outside the final validation log.

---

## Methodology

For each eligible deposit, the app estimates:

```text
Gross interest = Capital × TANB × Maturity / 12
Withholding tax = Gross interest × Tax rate
Net interest = Gross interest - Withholding tax
Estimated final amount = Capital + Net interest
```

The default withholding tax assumption is based on a 28% Portuguese tax rate for interest income.

The calculations are simplified estimates and may not reflect all possible fees, tax situations, account costs, exemptions or special product conditions.

## Main Dataset

The core dataset is stored in:

```text
data/depositos_prazo_core_portugal_corrigido.csv
```

Main fields include:

- Bank
- Product
- Term in months
- TANB
- Minimum amount
- Maximum amount
- New-client requirement
- New-money requirement
- Early withdrawal
- IRS applicability
- IRS tax rate
- Notes and validation observations
- Official source/reference
- Reference date

---

## Official Source Mapping

Official source links are stored in:

```text
data/source_links.csv
```

This file maps each bank/product to a source such as:

- official product page;
- FIN/PDF document;
- price list or preçário;
- secondary official page.

Typical fields:

```text
Banco
Produto
Tipo Fonte
URL
Campo a validar
Estado auditoria
Ativo
Notas auditoria
```

Run the source coverage audit with:

```bash
python scripts/audit_source_coverage.py
```

This checks whether products in the dataset have a matching source entry.

---

## AI-Assisted Validation Workflow

The project includes an AI-assisted workflow to compare dataset values with official bank sources.

The AI does not directly update the final dataset or validation log. It only proposes validation results. Human approval is required before a record is added to the final validation log.

### 1. Generate validation proposals for one bank

```bash
python scripts/ai_propose_validations_append.py --bank "Banco BiG"
```

The script reads the dataset, fetches the official source, sends the extracted source text to the AI model, and writes proposed validation results to:

```text
validation/proposed_validations_ai_master.csv
```

### 2. Generate validation proposals for all products

```bash
python scripts/ai_propose_all_append.py
```

This processes all dataset rows and appends only new proposals to the master proposal file.

### 3. Mark safe proposals as approved

```bash
python scripts/mark_master_ready_proposals_as_approved.py
```

This automatically approves only proposals where the key fields match safely:

```text
TANB match = Yes
Maturity match = Yes
Min amount match = Yes
Max amount match = Yes
Early withdrawal match = Yes
```

Rows with `Unknown`, `No`, `AI_Error`, `No_Source_Found` or `Needs_Manual_Review` are left for manual review.

### 4. Apply approved validations to the final log

```bash
python scripts/apply_approved_master_validations.py
```

Approved validations are written to:

```text
validation/bank_rate_validation_log.csv
```

### 5. Deduplicate the validation log

```bash
python scripts/deduplicate_validation_log.py
```

This keeps the final validation log clean and avoids repeated records.

---

## Manual Review Queue

Products that cannot be safely validated are exported to:

```text
validation/manual_review_summary.csv
```

Examples of reasons for manual review:

- official website blocks automated access;
- source returns 403 or 404;
- TANB could not be extracted reliably;
- minimum or maximum amount is not clearly stated;
- early withdrawal conditions are ambiguous;
- product source needs manual confirmation.

This ensures that uncertain records are not automatically treated as validated.

---

## Current Validation Status

The current validation log includes approved records for products such as:

- Banco Invest — Invest Choice Novos Montantes;
- Banco BiG — Super Depósito 3 Meses;
- Banco BiG — Super Depósito 6 Meses;
- Caixa Geral de Depósitos — DP Boas Vindas;
- Banco CTT — DP Novos Montantes;
- Openbank — Depósito Open 6 Meses Novos Clientes;
- Banco Português de Gestão — BPG Start;
- Banco Finantia — Depósito a Prazo Jump;
- Banco Finantia — Depósito a Prazo Visão;
- Banco Best — Depósito Novos Clientes.

Some products remain in manual review where source extraction is uncertain, blocked or requires manual confirmation.

---

## Data Quality & Human Validation

The app uses a manually curated dataset and does not automatically update deposit rates or product conditions without review.

Validation controls include:

- Dataset reference date
- Last manual validation date
- Official source tracking
- Source coverage audit
- Local validation reports
- Snapshot baseline monitoring
- FIN/PDF review workflow
- AI-generated validation proposals
- Human approval before final validation
- Manual review notes and exception queues

This approach reflects a conservative data governance process where source changes can be detected, but final validation requires controlled approval.

---

## FIN/PDF Validation Workflow

Place one or more official FIN/PDF documents inside:

```text
incoming_fin/
```

Then run:

```bash
python scripts/read_fin_pdf.py
```

The script generates:

```text
validation/fin_pdf_review.md
```

This file summarizes extracted fields and provides a human validation section where the reviewer can record:

- Human decision
- Validator notes
- Manual corrections
- Confirmation of key product conditions

Uploaded PDFs are intentionally ignored by Git and should not be committed to the repository.

---

## Source Monitoring Workflow

Run source monitoring:

```bash
python scripts/monitor_sources.py
```

Generate validation summary:

```bash
python scripts/validation_summary.py
```

Generate grouped review:

```bash
python scripts/generate_grouped_review.py
```

Accept validated source snapshots:

```bash
python scripts/monitor_sources.py --accept-snapshots
```

---

## Approved Dataset Update Workflow

When a source change requires a controlled dataset update, generate proposed updates:

```bash
python scripts/propose_dataset_updates.py
```

Review the generated file:

```text
validation/proposed_updates.csv
```

Approve only the rows that should update the dataset, then run:

```bash
python scripts/apply_approved_updates.py
```

This ensures that dataset changes are not applied automatically without human approval.

---
